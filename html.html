<p>Nature is the heart of the earth . Nature heals us . We have a strong bond and emotional connection with nature . Things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies and much more are part of nature. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources.We know that the natural environment provides us with a wide range of 'ecosystem services': all the things that people need and want that come from the natural world of which human beings are a part. We receive provisioning services food, fibre, energy, drinking water, building materials, natural medicine.The nature is beautiful, a blessing, fragile, helpful, important, comforting. A mother is also beautiful, loving, caring, responsible, a gift from god, aspiring.The beauty of nature can have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it results in disbelief in its very existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or amazement.</p>
